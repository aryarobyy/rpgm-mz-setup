"," "," It is possible to place both an upper layer and lower layer tile on the same location on the map. By using this two-layer composition, it is possible to create a very detailed and intricate map. "," ","As a standard, tiles that represent things such as the ocean, fields, floors, and walls are the lower layer tiles, and tiles used to decorate those layers are arranged on the upper layer.

For maps larger than this, the area displayed will automatically center on the position of the player (scroll processing).

For example, in a map which has a tile size of 100x100, the coordinates of the bottom right corner would be (99,99).
