			<p class="text">All images must be in the PNG format.</p>
			<ul class="ul--2c--line mb90px">
				<li>
					<h3>Battlebacks (img/battlebacks1, img/battlebacks2)</h3>
					<p>
						Images used as the backgrounds for the Battle Screen. <br/>A battleback measures 1000x740 pixels in size. Backgrounds in the &quot;battlebacks1&quot; folder are primarily for floors, and those in the &quot;battlebacks2&quot; folder are primarily for walls. You can arrange these in any combination that you like in order to create your battleback. <br/>The upper part of images in front-view battles and the lower part of images in side-view battles will be cropped when displayed.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Front-View Enemies (img/enemies)</h3>
					<p>
						Images for enemies that are displayed in front-view battle. You can choose any size you want for the image. <br/><br/>*There is a possibility that images with a width (horizontal direction) that is an odd number will be blurred when displayed. Even numbers are recommended.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Face (img/faces)</h3>
					<p>
						Images which are displayed in the Menu Screen and message windows. <br/>Face images are 144x144 pixels in size, and arranged into 2 rows and 4 columns equaling 8 images.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Parallax (img/parallaxes)</h3>
					<p>
						Images shown behind maps. You can choose any size you want for the image. <br/>Like wallpaper, the top, bottom, left, and right sides of the image will be connected when you wish to loop the image. <br/>Additionally, parallax files will be treated as floors (no parallax) when there is a &quot;!&quot; at the beginning of the file name.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Pictures (img/pictures)</h3>
					<p>
						Images which are displayed by using event commands during the game. You can choose any size you want for the image. <br/><br/>*There is a possibility that images with a width (horizontal direction) that is an odd number will be blurred when displayed. Even numbers are recommended.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Side-view Allies (img/sv_actors)</h3>
					<p>
						Actor images which are displayed in side-view battle. <br/>Please refer to [<a href="01_11_02.html">Side-view Character Standards</a>].
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Side-View Enemies (img/sv_enemies)</h3>
					<p>
						Images for enemies that are displayed in side-view battle. You can choose any size you want for the image. <br/><br/>*There is a possibility that images with a width (horizontal direction) that is an odd number will be blurred when displayed. Even numbers are recommended.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Tilesets (img/tilesets)</h4>
					<p>
						Images which consist of the tiles (also known as map chips) that make up a map.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Title Screen (img/titles1, img/titles2)</h4>
					<p>
						Images displayed on the Title Screen. <br/>The size for these images is 816x624 pixels. Titles1 contains files for the main background, and titles2 contains images for frames, etc. Use these in any combination to create the Title Screen.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Characters (img/characters)</h3>
					<p>
						Images shown for the characters on the map. <br/>The size for a character image can be changed freely (normally 48x48 pixels), and consist of 4 directions (up, down, left, right) and 3 patterns for a total of 12 patterns that will be arranged in the provided order. A file for 1 character will be arranged into 2 rows and 4 columns, totaling 8 images. The size of the character will be calculated using 1/12 of the width and 1/8 of the height of this file. Moreover, characters will be shown 1/8 above a tile so they appear more natural when on top of buildings.

						</p><ul class="ul">
							<li>It is possible to treat 1 character as 1 file by including &quot;$&quot; at the beginning of the file name.</li>
							<li>Including a &quot;!&quot; at the beginning of the file name will prevent the image from being shifted 1/8 up, and bush elements will no longer make it appear half-transparent. This is primarily used for map objects such as doors and treasure chests.</li>
							<li>It is also possible to use the &quot;$&quot; and &quot;!&quot; special characters together.</li>
						</ul>
					<p></p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>System Images (img/system)</h3>
					<p>
						Various images used throughout the game.

						<dd>Asset used for actor chat balloons. The transparent area below the image is defined by the user.</dd>
						<dt>ButtonSet.png</dt>
						<dd>Button assets used with touch controls. These can be used for things like opening the menu, canceling, returning to previous, or changing the number of items when using the shop.</dd>

						<dd>
						Asset for the states of allies in side-view battle.<br/>
						</dd>
						<dt>Weapons1.png, Weapons2.png, Weapons3.png</dt>
						<dd>
						The weapon images that are displayed when allies perform normal attacks in side-view battle. <br/>There are 12 different types of images for Weapons1 and Weapons2. Weapons3 is defined by the user.

					<p>Autotiles used as deep sea tiles. Only tiles in this block can create a boundary line with ocean tiles when adjoined to A1 (Animation) tiles. Also, tiles in Block A will automatically fill in the transparent sections of this block.
