			<h3 class="title--h3">
				Autonomous Movement
			</h3>
			<p class="text--sub">Specifies how the Map Event will move based on the [Type], [Speed], and [Frequency] settings. [Speed] determines the speed at which a Map Event moves. The greater the number, the faster it will move. [Frequency] is the interval at which the map event moves. The greater the number, the shorter the movement interval will be. You can choose from the following 4 types of movements in [Type].</p>
			<ul class="ul--2c--line--align mb90px">
