<h2>GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</h2>
<p>Version 3, 29 June 2007</p>

<p>Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
	&lt;<a href="https://fsf.org/" target="_blank">https://fsf.org/</a>&gt;</p><p>
	Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
	of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
   
   <p>This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
   the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
   License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.</p>
   
   <h3>0. Additional Definitions.</h3>
   
   <p>As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
   General Public License, and the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the GNU
   General Public License.</p>
   
   <p>“The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License,
   other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.</p>
   
   <p>An “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided
   by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
   Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
   of using an interface provided by the Library.</p>
   
   <p>A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an
   Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
   with which the Combined Work was made is also called the “Linked
   Version”.</p>
   
   <p>The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the
   Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
   for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
   based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.</p>
   
   <p>The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the
   object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
   and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
   Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.</p>
   
   <h3>1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.</h3>
   
   <p>You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
   without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.</p>
   
   <h3>2. Conveying Modified Versions.</h3>
   
   <p>If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
   facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
   that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
   facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
   version:</p>
   
   <ul>
   <li>a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
	  ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
	  function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
	  whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or</li>
   
   <li>b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
	  this License applicable to that copy.</li>
   </ul>
   
   <h3>3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.</h3>
   
   <p>The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
   a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
   code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
   material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
   layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
   (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:</p>
   
   <ul>
   <li>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
	  Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
	  covered by this License.</li>
   
   <li>b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
	  document.</li>
   </ul>
   
   <h3>4. Combined Works.</h3>
   
   <p>You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
   taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
   portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
   engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
   the following:</p>
   
   <ul>
   <li>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
	  the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
	  covered by this License.</li>
   
   <li>b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
	  document.</li>
   
   <li>c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
	  execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
	  these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
	  copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.</li>
   
   <li>d) Do one of the following:
   
   <ul>
   <li>0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
		  License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
		  suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
		  recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
		  the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
		  manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
		  Corresponding Source.</li>
   
   <li>1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
		  Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
		  a copy of the Library already present on the user&#39;s computer
		  system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
		  of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
		  Version.</li>
   </ul></li>
   
   <li>e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
	  be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
	  GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
	  necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
	  Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
	  Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
	  you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
	  the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
	  Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
	  Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
	  for conveying Corresponding Source.)</li>
   </ul>
   
   <h3>5. Combined Libraries.</h3>
   
   <p>You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
   Library side by side in a single library together with other library
   facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
   License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
   choice, if you do both of the following:</p>
   
   <ul>
   <li>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
	  on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
	  conveyed under the terms of this License.</li>
   
   <li>b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
	  is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
	  accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</li>
   </ul>
   
   <h3>6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.</h3>
   
   <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
   of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
   versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
   differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>
   
   <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
   Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
   of the GNU Lesser General Public License “or any later version”
   applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
   conditions either of that published version or of any later version
   published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
   received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
   General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
   General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</p>
   
   <p>If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
   whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
   apply, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of any version is
   permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
   Library.</p>
