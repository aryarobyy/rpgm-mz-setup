GNU\n   General Public License.","\n\n   ","“The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License,\n   other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.","\n\n   ","An “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided\n   by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\n   Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\n   of using an interface provided by the Library.","\n\n   ","A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an\n   Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\n   with which the Combined Work was made is also called the “Linked\n   Version”.","\n\n   ","The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the\n   Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\n   for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\n   based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.","\n\n   ","The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the\n   object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\n   and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\n   Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.","\n\n   ","\n\n   ","You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\n   without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.","\n\n   ","\n\n   ","If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\n   facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\n   that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\n   facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\n   version:","\n\n   ","\n   ","a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n\t  ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n\t  function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n\t  whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or","\n\n   ","b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n\t  this License applicable to that copy.","\n   ","\n\n   ","\n\n   ","The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\n   a header file that is part of the Library.

A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n\t\t  a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n\t\t  system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n\t\t  of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n\t\t  Version.","\n   ","\n\n   ","e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n\t  be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n\t  GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n\t  necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n\t  Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n\t  Application with a modified version of the Linked Version.

Such new\n   versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\n   differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.","\n\n   ","Each version is given a distinguishing version number.
